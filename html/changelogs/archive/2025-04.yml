  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: Fish will no longer drown if left half-submerged in a fishable turf on
      which it can normally be found. Instead it will disperse after a while or if
      starving. Note that this only happens if the fish is native to such turfs (eg.
      lavaloop on beach water will still die).
  SmArtKar:
  - bugfix: Fixed gas station and phonebooth ruins magically summoning weather on
      bottom levels of Icebox

  TiviPlus:
  - refactor: "Logging and IC timestamps will now always use UTC\xB10 and not be affected\
      \ by server system timezone changes"
  - bugfix: "Station and round times will not longer be incorrect if the system timezone\
      \ is not UTC\xB10"
  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - code_imp: Any tgui message that would be too big to send to the server is now
      split into chunks and sent in sequence. This fixes several issues, such as...
  - bugfix: It is once again possible to save large amounts of text on paper at once.
  jlsnow301:
  - bugfix: Fixed the circuit UI titlebar spacing
  - bugfix: The library console has been refactored. Report any issues in the github!
  timothymtorres:
  - map: Move mafia, CTF, and deathmatch maps into minigame folder

  Absolucy:
  - refactor: Refactored some code related to initialization.
  - code_imp: Runtime errors will now print to the chat while debugging.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Minor mining voucher refactor, report any oddities.
  - qol: All spell invocations have been made a bit more consistent - some have changed
      slightly, some are now punctuated. "Dragon Form" and "Bear Form" are now emotes
      invocations.
  - qol: '"Unknown" mobs are now properly referred to as they/them'
  - qol: Burning paper (and similar) is now two way. Rather than needing to click
      on the paper with a burning item, you can now click on a burning item with the
      paper. This means you can burn paper on your lit cigarette like a badass.
  - qol: You can now light cigarettes on candles.
  - rscdel: Flares and candles can no longer craft into flashlight eyes, I guess.

  Jacquerel:
  - rscadd: Handcuffed people can now be tied to the tram rails
  - balance: tram rails will no longer electrocute you if they're not powered
  Singul0:
  - rscadd: You can now flip tables by right clicking them!
  SmArtKar:
  - balance: Restaurant portals can now be printed, constructed and deconstructed.
      They're also no longer completely invulnerable.
  Watermelon914:
  - refactor: Refactored subsystem initialization
  necromanceranne:
  - bugfix: Attempts were made to make chemical interactions with regards to splashes
      or exposure to chemicals on your skin respect clothing cover. If you have clothing
      with biological protecting properties, chemicals may not affect you as easily.
      Good for you.
  - balance: Some chems may behave differently than they originally did in light of
      utilizing suit protections appropriately. Make sure if you want someone to be
      exposed to the full effect of a chemical that they're not wearing anything in
      the way before splashing them.
